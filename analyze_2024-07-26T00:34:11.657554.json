There are several cars parked along the street, and a white van with a red stripe and the word \"Purolator\" on its side is driving down the street. The van appears to be a delivery vehicle, possibly for a company that provides pest control services.\n\nThe scene is a typical residential area with houses, trees, and a sidewalk. The sky is overcast, suggesting it might be a cloudy day. There is nothing out of place in the scene; it appears to be a normal day in a residential neighborhood. "]]
