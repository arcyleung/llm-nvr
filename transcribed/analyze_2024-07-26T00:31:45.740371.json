There are several cars parked along the street, and a white van with a red stripe and the word \"Purolator\" on its side is driving down the street. The van is in the center of the image, and it appears to be in motion, possibly delivering or picking up items. The cars are parked on both sides of the street, and there are no people or other objects that are clearly visible in the image. "]]
