The individual is wearing a dark-colored top and dark pants, and they appear to be walking away from the camera, towards the right side of the image.\n\nThere are several cars parked in the driveway of the houses. The cars vary in color and model, and they are parked in a way that suggests they are part of the residents' vehicles.\n\nThe houses themselves are two-story structures with pitched roofs. The one on the left has a darker roof, while the one on the right has a lighter roof. Both houses have white trim around the windows and doors.\n\nThe sky is clear with a few clouds, and the overall lighting suggests it is a bright day.
